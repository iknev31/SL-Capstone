Mango Supply Chain
Course-end Project 4

DESCRIPTION

Many people across the globe are getting sick due to the lack of food hygiene. 
A better tracking technique is required to trace back the origin of the food item so that the end user can authenticate food items and consume them without any worry.


Background of the problem statement:

Food quality and safety is one of the hot topics today where everyone is concerned about the food quality that they are consuming.

Food items like fruits generally donâ€™t have any expiry date mentioned so it becomes really important to understand the origin of these food items and understand when the farmer sent it to the distributor and so on. 
Generally, the below cycle is followed in supply chain for fruit items:

Producer: The producer can harvest fruits, sell them to distributors, and track authenticity.
Distributor: The distributor can buy the fruits, distribute them, and track authenticity.
Retailer: The retailer can buy the fruits, put them for sale, and track authenticity.
Consumer: The consumer can buy the fruits and track authenticity.
 

Features of the application:

Mango as an asset has the following parameters:

productId: Asset Id
productDescription: Description of the asset
producerName: Producer or farmer name
producerAddress: Producer or farmer address
harvestDate: Harvest date
distributorName: Distributor name
distributorAddress: Distributor address
prodToDistDate: Producer to distributor transfer date
retailerName: Retailer name
retailerAddress: Retailer address
distToRetaDate: Distributor to retailer transfer date
